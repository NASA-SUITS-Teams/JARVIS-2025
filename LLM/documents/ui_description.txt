The UI is broken into a widget panel with multiple modular widgets and a side panel. The user can customize the 
widgets, choosing which ones to display and how to display them (size and location on screen).

The map widget contains an overhead map of a larger section of the moon's surface and the testing 
location(s). There is an option to view a larger zoomed-out snippet of the moon's surface, as well as an option 
to view just the test location (Rock Yard). The map allows the user to drop geopins on areas of interest and then 
generate a shortest path from the pressurized rover's current position to a selected pin. 

The ALERTS widget displays updates on the environment, such as critical notifications regarding the state of the 
rover and EVAs, and/or any errors that must be addressed. These notifications are color-coded by urgency, with red 
being the most critical state. 

The LLM widget contains an interface to interact with JARVIS. Here, you can interact with JARVIS directly through 
text input or transcribed oral prompts. JARVIS has access to execute backend functions and can assist the user with 
system operations. 

The MAP TOGGLES widget allows the user to filter out the data displayed on the map, allowing customization of the
viewing platform and decluttering capabilities. 

ROVER PROCEDURES provides a visual guide and interactive checklist for the tasks the rover operator must complete. 

The RESOURCE CONSUMPTION widget allows the user to input a time interval, and the module will return the resources
that are expected to be consumed in that time, such as the battery level, oxygen level/pressure, and cabin 
temperature. 

SCAN DATA displays the data retrieved from the rock scans taken by the two EVAs. 

ROVER CONTROLS provides a way to interface with certain rover processes, such as turning headlights on/off, air
conditioning, etc. 

The EVA TIMER displays the timers and statuses of the EVA Telemetry stations. 

The VIDEO FEEDS provide a way to stream LTV, EVA#1, and EVA#2 camera feeds. 

The side panel on the right provides a way to interact with the system controls. Under quick actions, the user 
can add geopins on the map, reset the map, and scan the terrain. Under System States, there are 4 buttons: ROVER, 
EVA#1, EVA#1, and UIA. Each one is a selectable default state for the widget panel for quick access to filter for 
relevant widgets. Below this is a display for rover data, such as battery level, brakes, cabin pressure, etc.
