# JARVIS-2025

<h2>Introduction!</h2>
Hello everyone! We are Team JARVIS from Purdue University and Indiana State University. 

We highly encourage you to watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUtbqF5x5as">introduction video</a> to learn more about us! 


We are developing the Pressurized Rover display and control system and the interoperability system to communicate data with our partner team, Aether-Net, at UT Austin.

<h2>Directory Structure:</h2>
Our directory structure will contain folders for each major feature we develop, which are as follows. 

|Feature|Description|
| :---: | --- |
|UI/PR Display|*Maps, Tracking EV Locations (take data thru LunarLink), Pin System, Path Features, Topographical Data, Toggle multiple maps/different features*|
|Pathfinding|*Using A**, *Turnaround Point implementation*|
|LLM|*Serving as an assistant of sorts; 'Jarvis' for JARVIS, a bit like "Hey Siri", but responds to "Hey Jarvis"*|
|LiDAR|*Using Echolocation with Lazers to provide 3D visualization from point cloud*|
|Controller|*Xbox Controller piping commands to TSS and to DUST*|
|Task Priority Queue|*Taking resource consumption and task priorities (L, M, H) and suggesting a task queue*|
|Resource consumption and Turnaround Points|*Predicting future resource use, and how that affects the paths the rover is able to take*|

LunarLink
Instructions TBD
We intend to create a separate repo for this so its easier to clone
